# Special Relativity in Mathematica

This repository contains my notes and Mathematica library
for Einstein's Special Relativity that I developed while
reading on the subject.

Demo files:

- [4-Vectors and basic operations](FourVectors.nb)
- [Constant Speed Motion](ConstantSpeedMotion.nb)
- [Circular Motion](CircularMotion.nb)
- [Hyperbolic Motion (Constant Acceleration)](HyberbolicNotion.nb)

[PDF Exports](pdf/) of some notebooks since github doesn't render
mathematica pages.
